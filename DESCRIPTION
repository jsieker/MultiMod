Title: Expands WGCNA Clustering Analysis by Introducing a Pathway for Multiple Module Gene Assignment 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jeremy Sieker, Sohyon Lee, Kristin Baldwin
Maintainer: Jeremy Sieker <jsieker@ucsd.edu>
Description: WGCNA Gene Clustering Analysis makes the assumption that each gene under consideration is only
properly assignable to one module. This package designs a workaround into the WGCNA analytical protocol which
allows for otherwise identical clustering analysis, minus the unimodularity assumption. With this method
alteration, more accurate gene clustering maps can now be developed.
